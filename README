Hi, 

I was bored so I had to write something quick...

I call it PyMos, I should've called it PyMosaic, but that sounds too long.

It does something like this to input.jpg using collection/* as seen here - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideamonk/4020798966/sizes/l/

How to make your own -
  grab some image, put it as input.jpg besides script
  grab some matching color images, push them into collection, keep smalls images
  how to - goto flickr.com search something, n.times do{ rightclick, save }
  run the script, let it work
  stare/zoom around output.png, show it to friends, feel k3wl

Then one night came YuviPanda and he hacked a little, hacked some more, and 
hacked till sunrise to add most of the + on the todos

TODO
  
    [+] get rid of spaghetti
    [+] improved color matching
        - euclidean distance FTW
    [+] More generic/re-usable code / driver-worker separation as we call it
    [ ] make source_color average for a region if optimal / is slow
    [+] use pickle to avoid colormap regeneration, update when user desires
        + now it auto updates the cache
    [ ] optimize by resize reduction - some DP to be done
