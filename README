Hi, 
I was bored so I had to write something quick...
I call it PyMos, I should've called it PyMosaic, but that sounds too long.
It does something like this to images/foo.jpg using kids/* as seen here - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideamonk/4020798966/sizes/l/
Have Fun

    [ ] improved color matching
    [ ] make source_color average for a region if optimal
    [ ] use pickle to avoid colormap regeneration, update when user desires
